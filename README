This program computes the entropy in a PUF array following HDM and Code offset masking with BCH.
It requires the underlying per bit entropy from the array (default 0.9), the HDM percentage (default 20%) and the HDM targeting factor which is the percentage of unstable bits captured by the HDM (default 0.8).
Currently the settings are in the code and you will need to edit them for your array.
I'll add command line options sometime.

It computes the entropy and reliability ovar all combinations of array_size in [], BER from 0 to 16% in steps of 1% and every narrow sense BCH code up to n=1023.
The output is in CSV format.
